# linux-rcs
Simple configurations to make working with the terminal a bit easier.

## Settings
- Adds alias for git related commands
- Changes up and down keys to autocomplete with history instead of choosing the previous/next command ran

## Usage
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stein212/linux-rcs/master/add-rcs.sh)"
```
OR

Copy them in your home folder.

---

Then restart the session to apply the change.

## Note
Mainly for NUS systems, probably does not work for all.

## .vimrc
- Create `~/.vim/undodir` so that it can store undofiles(?)
