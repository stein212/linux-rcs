# linux-rcs
Simple configurations to make working with the terminal a bit easier.

## Settings
- Adds alias for git related commands
- Changes up and down keys to autocomplete with history instead of choosing the previous/next command ran

## Usage
Copy them in your home folder and restart the session (sourcing .inputrc does not work).

## Note
Mainly for NUS systems, probably does not work for all.
